Submenu is a WordPress plug-in that enhances the WordPress 3.x navigation system and allows you to put menus or portion of menus anywhere in your site.

== Description ==

Submenu is a WordPress plug-in that enhances the WordPress 3.x navigation system. When you have a website based on WordPress with a lot of pages, but you need a custom menu, it can be tedious to have to add a menu entry for each created page.

Submenu just does it automatically.

Submenu also allows you to put menus or portion of menus anywhere in your site: sidebar, templates or page contents.
